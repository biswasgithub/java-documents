Push existion project to Git*** 
Clone: git clone https://github.com/URL-TO-REPO-HERE
1. Change to the root of the local repository:
	$ cd <repo_name>

2. initialized the repository:
	$ git init

3. Check status:
	$ git status 

4. List all your branches:
	$ git branch -a

5. Checkout the branch you want to use.
	$ git checkout <feature_branch>
	
6. Create a new branch:
	$ git checkout -b new-branch existing-branch 
	(This creates a new branch new-branch, based on existing-branch. The -b flag tells it to create a new branch at the same time	

7. create new branch and Switch to new branch:	
	$ git checkout -b amend-my-name (created a new branch and Switched to a new branch 'amend-my-name')

8. Confirm you are now working on that branch:
	$ git branch

9. Delete branch:
	$ git branch -d <branch>
	
10. Stage your changes:
	$ git add . / git add -A  (adds the entire project to the staging area)
	$ git add <fileName>  (Git moves all changes of <file> in the staging area to wait for the next commit.)
	& git add <DirectoryName>  (adds the entire <directory> to the staging area) 

11. Commit your changes:
	$ git commit -m "Commit message" 

12. Push your changes to GitHub:
	$ git push <remote> <branch>
	$ git push origin amend-my-name
	$ git push -f origin master

13. set origin: add existion project to gitHub:(sequnce of step:1->2->3->4->->5->6->7 )
	$ git remote add origin <url of the branch>
	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/biswasgithub/employee-consumer.git

14. git pull:
	When you are executing pull command it will execute two commands in background.
				first fetch and then merge
	Fetch command will download all files from remote repo to local repo.
	
	C push his changes(line 15,16) in branch feature/MER-12. You are working on same branch and made your chandes(Line 20,21). While committing your code 
	1st you have to fetch the updated version of feature/MER-12 branch and then you have to commit. So "git pull" will be used. git pull 1st fetch the 
	updated version(Line 15,16) and then merge your changes with updated version (Line 15,16,20,21). Then commit.
	If you don't fetch the updated version and try to commit the you will get error.
	
	In git bash write: git pull  then open GitGUI and commit.

15. commit exiting project folder to git:
	git init
	git status
	git add -A
	git status
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git remote add origin remoteRepositoryURL
	git push -f origin master

16. commit exiting project to git:
	git init -> git add . -> git commit -m "initial commit" -> git remote add origin remoteRepositoryURL -> git remote -v -> git push -f origin master

******Note:
Problem:
$ git push -f origin master
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights

Solution: set remoti origin by usnig- $ git remote add origin https://github.com/biswasgithub/employee-consumer.git

Problem: 
	error: pathspec 'BRANCH-NAME' did not match any file(s) known to git.
	ans: git remote update
	git fetch 
	git checkout -b <branch name>
